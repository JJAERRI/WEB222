      <h3>What is braised spicy chicken?</h3>
      <p>
         It is a traditional spicy chicken stew in Korea. If you read it literally in Korean, it is
        <span class="bold-text">Dak-bokkeum-tang.</span> It is a dish made by seasoning chicken,
        potatoes, carrots, onions, etc. with red pepper paste, red pepper powder, and soy sauce, and
        it boasts a spicy yet deep taste. The name 'Dak-bokkeum-tang' comes from a recipe for
        roasting ingredients and then adding more soup to the stew. <br />
        It is a spicy food. Just as spicy food is popular in Korea, it is very popular and loved by
        Koreans.

      <p>
        Braised spicy chicken is a representative home-style dish in Korea with a long history and
        tradition. There is a theory that the word "dori" originated from Japanese, but recently,
        some people interpret it as a Korean dialect. It is very popular in the cold winter because
        it is a hot dish, but it is actually a popular dish regardless of the season.<br />
        People eat it as an *Anju or as a meal. When it's eaten as a meal, it's usually served with
        white rice. Personally, I think it goes well with soju, which is a Korean alcoholic
        beverage, and I don't think it goes well with whiskey or wine.<br>
        <span class="light-text">*Anju is a Korean term for food consumed with alcohol.</span></span>

  <p>This food is a traditional Korean chicken stew with a spicy, rich flavor that's easy to make at home with a variety of ingredients and spices. It's a nutritious and healthy dish, and you can try different variations for even more flavor. Dakbokkeumtang (닭볶음탕), also known as Dakdoritang (닭도리탕), is a traditional Korean chicken stew celebrated for its spicy, rich flavor. This dish, a staple in Korean cuisine, is beloved by those who enjoy robust and spicy food. Dakbokkeumtang is more than just a meal; it's a reflection of Korean culinary traditions that emphasize bold flavors and communal eating. Perfect for sharing with friends and family, this stew is usually eaten with steamed rice on a side. It enhances the whole meal experience by matching very nicely with the popular Korean alcoholic beverage, soju. This stew is not only delicious but also nutritious; chicken offers a solid source of protein and the vegetables include vital minerals and vitamins. For people who prefer strong, fiery dishes, chili peppers are a quite healthy choice since they help to boost metabolism. Dakbokkeumtang can be tailored to fit several palates. Though some recipes call for sweet potatoes, mushrooms, or zucchini, vegetables can be customized to fit taste. Some chefs may toss a dash of rice wine or fish sauce for an added depth of taste. Its delicate chicken and strong, fiery broth make for a filling and consoling meal. This stew provides a great gastronomic experience regardless of your level of cooking skill; it is really simple to cook. I would strongly suggest this dish to anyone who enjoys chicken made in a Korean way and is a lover of spicy food. If you are a lover of soju, which is a type of alcoholic beverage that is popular in Korea, I strongly suggest that you try it with it. It is going to fascinate your pallets, and I am certain that you are going to adore it!</p>
