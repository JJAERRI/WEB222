      <h2>Introduce Me</h2>
      <p>
        Hello, my name is Chaerin Yoo. I'm from South Korea. I'm studying computer programming at
        Seneca college. This is my first time studying a computer subject. So everything is
        difficult for me, but I think web subjects are interesting for me. I'm so happy that I can
        introduce my favorite Korean food through this assignment. I'm proud of everything in my
        country and I want to introduce many things because there are many interesting things. And
        also this is my first time to make a site using HTML and CSS, but it was very fun. I
        definitely want to make my own site by combining JS, HTML, and CSS through this class, so
        I'm looking forward to the rest of the web class.
